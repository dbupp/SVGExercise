## TASK: Design and develop an app that produces two “slides” showing a title and graphic based on data. 
  Create 2 slides that have a title and a svg graphic that depicts:
* Slide 1: Change in Quantity Sold per Type between 2018 and 2019
* Slide 2: Market Share For each type for year 2019
    
Feel free to us any type of graphic representation:barchart, linechart, pie charts, scatter charts, etc. 
The application needs only to use C# and output either 1 or 2 files,  These files should able to be renderd in a browser (be sure to mention which browser was used in case of any capability issues). The files can contain html, javascript, svg, etc.  Anything that allows the file to be rendered properly, but graphic must be svg. 

The applicant should be prepared eplain the process used to solve the issue and demonstrate knowledge of object oriented development. Using 3rd party libraries is allowed, Be sure to include any notes, documentation, and how testing was performed.
